You can also **increment or decrement dates**:

* While editing a block, press `Ctrl-Alt-Up/Down` to increment/decrement any date inside. If a block has multiple dates, place your cursor on the date.
    
### Spaced Repetition

Implements SM2 Spaced repetition algorithm (Anki version) as described here: https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/faqs?id=what-spaced-repetition-algorithm-does-anki-use for Roam blocks.  
Put a cursor inside the block and pres Ctrl+Shift+ [number between 1 and 4 signifying ease of remembering this card], and the plugin is going to reschedule the Block accordingly (tagging it with the appropriate date, and some metadata tags)
